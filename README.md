# Pong-with-AI
This is my third year project.
The aim of this project was to create an AI agent that could proficiently play pong against a human player. 
The base game is made in Unity and the AI agent is trained in python using Tensorflow API.
The tensorflow API is connects to Unity using my localhost:6666 using juypter notebook.
The Agent is trained in the Unity environment using the parameters specified in the python code (hyperparameters).
